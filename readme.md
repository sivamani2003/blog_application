# Project Setup and Execution

This project consists of two main parts: the frontend and the backend.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with npm)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional, if cloning the repository)

## Directory Structure
The project structure:
```
project-root/
├── frontend/
├── backend/
```

---

## Frontend

### Setup
1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Run the Frontend
Run the following command to start the frontend:
```bash
npm run
```

The frontend application should now be running locally (by default on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), depending on your setup).

---

## Backend

### Setup
1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Run the Backend
Run the following command to start the backend server:
```bash
npm start
```

The backend server should now be running locally (by default on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000), depending on your setup).

---

## Notes
- Ensure both frontend and backend are running concurrently for the full application to function.
- If you encounter issues, verify that all dependencies are correctly installed and no processes are already using the required ports.

---

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
1. **Port Conflicts**
   If a port (3000 for frontend or 5000 for backend) is already in use, terminate the process or specify a new port.
   
2. **Missing `.env` File**
   Make sure the `backend/.env` file contains the necessary environment variables if your backend depends on it.
